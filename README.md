As machine learning continues to grow in today's world, some people may wonder what the future of music and song-making looks like. Can machines and data science be used to write melodies for a new song based on a given song? Employing a computational framework built in Python, exploring how music can be generated using a stochastic approach and basic machine learning to generate music from a random song seed using a stochastic process could be one possible solution. A seeding piece of music will be analyzed and used to create a Markov Chain stochastic process that composes a new originally unique musical piece. Notes and rests will be used as states, and the probability of the following state will be estimated from the seeding composition. The modeling framework will be allowed to compose its own music using stochastic state transitions by implementing a random initialization to set a starting state. Will this process produce a melody as catchy and successful as original pieces of work when using music by one of the top artists in the world, Taylor Swift?
